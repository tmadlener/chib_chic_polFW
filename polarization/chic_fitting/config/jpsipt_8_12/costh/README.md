The nominal model is the .json file placed in this directory. It is also used
for the lifetime significance cut variations as well as for the vertex 
probability cut variations. For some of the chosen cut values the values of the
start parameters in the nominal model do not lead to convergence for these
values new .json files with adapted start parameter values are placed into the
corresponding folders.

For the background model and the signal peak model checks the corresponding
files are placed in the respective subdirectories.
